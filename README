GoTools is an AIR project including several applications dealing with Gene Ontology.

Right now there are three different applications:

- GoAnnotation: For protein-term GO annotations and GoSlim jobs
- GoSlimChart: Charts representing GoSlim results
- GeneAnnotatedByGoTermChart: As its own name says, charts representing the relationships between annotated genes and Go terms.

.exe files for installing each application can be found on 'releases' top-level folder.
